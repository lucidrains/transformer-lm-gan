Explorations into adversarial losses on top of autoregressive loss for language modeling

I have tried this in the past, when GANs were still dominant. But at the time I was either too inexperienced or the research not there. Either way could not get it working. Will give it another shot in the next few weeks, mainly to see if an adversarial system could benefit [world modeling](https://github.com/lucidrains/improving-transformers-world-model-for-rl)
